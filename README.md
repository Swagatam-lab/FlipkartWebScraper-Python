🌐 Web Scraping Using Python
This project demonstrates how to scrape real-time data from websites using Python. The goal is to automate data extraction from web pages and convert unstructured HTML data into structured formats like CSV or JSON for analysis.

📌 Project Overview
Web scraping is a valuable skill for collecting public data from websites that don’t offer APIs. This project showcases how to:

Send requests to websites

Parse HTML using BeautifulSoup

Extract desired information

Save the data in a structured format

Handle pagination, headers, and exceptions

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

requests – to send HTTP requests

BeautifulSoup (from bs4) – to parse HTML content

pandas – to store and export data

time, random – to add delays between requests

📝 Features
✅ Extract product titles, prices, ratings, and links from e-commerce sites

✅ Save extracted data into .csv or .json

✅ Basic error handling and user-agent headers to prevent blocks

✅ Support for paginated scraping

📄 Example Use Case
Target Website: Sample e-commerce page (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Books to Scrape, etc.)

Extracted Data:

Product Name

Price

Rating

Product Link

python

    'Rating': [...],
    'Link': [...]
}
